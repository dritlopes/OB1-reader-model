0	There are now rumblings that Apple might soon invade the smart watch space, though the company is maintaining its customary silence. The watch doesn't have a microphone or speaker, but you can use it to control the music on your phone. You can glance at the watch face to view the artist and title of a song.

1	"Two days later, the British astronomer Richard Carrington was observing the interesting sunspot group through his telescope when he saw what he described as ""two patches of intensely bright and white light"" over the sunspots.

2	"I agree that California's ""three strikes and you're out"" law will be a financial disaster for taxpayers who care about education and other vital services.

3	Liza was in a bad temper, for she was mixing the Christmas puddings in the kitchen, and had been drawn from them, with a raisin still on her cheek, by Nana's absurd suspicions.

4	Mrs. Darling quivered and went to the window. It was securely fastened. She looked out, and the night was peppered with stars.

5	Seeing Peter slowly advancing upon him through the air with dagger poised, he sprang upon the bulwarks to cast himself into the sea.

6	Dorothy didn't know. She looked around her anxiously for some familiar landmark; but everything was strange.

7	The human body can tolerate only a small range of temperature, especially when the person is engaged in vigorous activity. Heat reactions usually occur when large amounts of water and/or salt are lost through excessive sweating following strenuous exercise.

8	It was a forbidding challenge, and it says much for Winstanley's persuasive abilities, not to mention his self-confidence, that the admiralty agreed to fund him.

10	Known as Rapa Nui to the island's inhabitants, Rongorongo is a writing system comprised of pictographs.

17	Even in the same animal, not all bites are the same. A new study finds that because the force in a muscle depends on how much it is stretched, an animal's bite force depends on the size of what it is biting.
