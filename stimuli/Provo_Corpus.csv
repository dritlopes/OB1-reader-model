1	There are now rumblings that Apple might soon invade the smart watch space, though the company is maintaining its customary silence. The watch doesn't have a microphone or speaker, but you can use it to control the music on your phone. You can glance at the watch face to view the artist and title of a song.

2	"Two days later, the British astronomer Richard Carrington was observing the interesting sunspot group through his telescope when he saw what he described as ""two patches of intensely bright and white light"" over the sunspots. He jotted a note in his painstaking record. That night there was scarcely a square inch of earth that was not illuminated by aurora.

3	"I agree that California's ""three strikes and you're out"" law will be a financial disaster for taxpayers who care about education and other vital services. But it's far from clear that the law can even be credited with a reduction in crime in California. While it's true that crime declined in California last year, crime also dropped nationwide."

4	Liza was in a bad temper, for she was mixing the Christmas puddings in the kitchen, and had been drawn from them, with a raisin still on her cheek, by Nana's absurd suspicions. She thought the best way of getting a little quiet was to take Nana to the nursery for a moment, but in custody of course.

5	Mrs. Darling quivered and went to the window. It was securely fastened. She looked out, and the night was peppered with stars. They were crowding round the house, as if curious to see what was to take place there, but she did not notice this, nor that one or two of the smaller ones winked at her.

6	Seeing Peter slowly advancing upon him through the air with dagger poised, he sprang upon the bulwarks to cast himself into the sea.

7	Dorothy didn't know. She looked around her anxiously for some familiar landmark; but everything was strange. Between the branches of the many roads were green meadows and a few shrubs and trees, but she couldn't see the farm-house from which she had just come, or anything she had ever seen before, except the shaggy man and Toto.

8	The human body can tolerate only a small range of temperature, especially when the person is engaged in vigorous activity. Heat reactions usually occur when large amounts of water and/or salt are lost through excessive sweating following strenuous exercise. When the body becomes overheated and cannot eliminate this excess heat, heat exhaustion and heat stroke are possible.

9	It was a forbidding challenge, and it says much for Winstanley's persuasive abilities, not to mention his self-confidence, that the admiralty agreed to fund him. No lighthouse had ever been built out to sea on an isolated rock before. The Eddystone is hard enough to avoid, but landing on it is a separate challenge entirely.

10	"A clergyman remarked to him, ""The Lord is on our side."" I am not at all concerned about that, replied Mr. Lincoln; ""for I know that the Lord is always on the side of the right.

11	Known as Rapa Nui to the island's inhabitants, Rongorongo is a writing system comprised of pictographs. It has been found carved into many oblong wooden tablets and other artifacts from the island's history. The art of writing was not known in any nearby islands and the script's mere existence is sufficient to confound anthropologists.

12	Some months later, Michael Larson saw another opportunity to stack the odds in his favor with a dash of ingenuity. He walked into his bank one day and asked to withdraw his entire account balance, but with an unusual stipulation: He wanted as much of the cash as possible in one dollar notes.

15	Greg Anderson, considered a key witness by the prosecution, vowed he wouldn't testify when served a subpoena last week.

16	Steam sterilization is limited in the types of medical waste it can treat, but is appropriate for laboratory cultures and substances contaminated with infectious organisms. The waste is subjected to steam in a sealed, pressurized chamber. The liquid that may form is drained off to the sewer or sent for processing.

17	Owls are more flexible than humans because a bird's head is only connected by one socket pivot. People have two, which limits our ability to twist, Forsman added. Owls also have multiple vertebrae, the small bones that make up the neck and spine, helping them achieve a wide range of motion.

18	Even in the same animal, not all bites are the same. A new study finds that because the force in a muscle depends on how much it is stretched, an animal's bite force depends on the size of what it is biting.

19	Interestingly, the heaviest isotopes physicists have managed to synthesize so far don't behave quite like science's best current models predict, so stable superheavy nuclei are likely to be full of surprises.

20	Buck did not like it, but he bore up well to the work, taking pride in it. It was a monotonous life, operating with machine-like regularity. One day was very like another. At a certain time each morning the cooks turned out, fires were built, and breakfast was eaten.

25	The girl's feet were then re-wrapped even tighter than before, causing her footprint to shrink further as the bones slowly fused into their new configuration.
